This is good, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

He opened the book and found the place where it was written, \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.\" And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, \"Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\" And all spoke well of him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth."

For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren.

It is God who justifies; who is to condemn?  It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.

And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been shortened, no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. Then if any one says to you, 'Lo, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. Lo, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, 'Lo, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out; if they say, 'Lo, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.

So his fellow servant fell down and besought him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you.'  He refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay the debt.  When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place.  Then his lord summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you besought me; and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?'  And in anger his lord delivered him to the torturers, till he should pay all his debt.  So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.\""

But, as it is written, \"What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him.\"",
    "gospel": "Matthew 10:37-42, 11:1\nThe Lord said, \"He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it. He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me. He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.\" And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities."

He said to the Jews, \"Behold your King!\" They cried out, \"Away with him, away with him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your King?\" The chief priests answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\" Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.\" Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.\n\nBut standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, \"Woman, behold your son!\" Then he said to the disciple, \"Behold your mother!\" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. Then when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished\"; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit."

For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.\" And the angel answered him, \"I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.\" And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they wondered at his delay in the temple. And when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them and remained dumb. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.\n\nAfter these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying, \"Thus the Lord has done to me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.\""

And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before him; but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. And when he saw their faith he said, \"Man, your sins are forgiven you.\" And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, \"Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?\" When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, \"Why do you question in your hearts? Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\" -- he said to the man who was paralyzed -- \"I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home.\" And immediately he rose before them, and took up that on which he lay, and went home, glorifying God.

For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. Now I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is bound to keep the whole law. You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness.

I wish those who unsettle you would mutilate themselves! For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants of one another.

But I say, walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you would. But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, murder, drunkenness, carousing, and the like.

For the measure you give will be the measure you get back.\"\n\nHe also told them a parable: \"Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? A disciple is not above his teacher, but every one when he is fully taught will be like his teacher. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.\n\n\"For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush.

Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.\" And Jesus answering said to him, \"Simon, I have something to say to you.\" And he answered, \"What is it, Teacher?\" \"A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?\" Simon answered, \"The one, I suppose, to whom he forgave more.\" And he said to him, \"You have judged rightly.\" Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I entered your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.\" And he said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, \"Who is this, who even forgives sins?\" And he said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\""

For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it; and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and had called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.",

When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me.\" For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him; he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters, but he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the desert.) Jesus then asked him, \"What is your name?\" And he said, \"Legion\"; for many demons had entered him. And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them leave. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. When the herdsmen saw what happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. And those who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was healed. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear; so he got into the boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but he sent him away, saying, \"Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.\" And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him."

    "epistle": "I Corinthians 12:27-31;13:1-8\nBrethren, you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.  And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then healers, helpers, administrators, speakers in various kinds of tongues.  Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all teachers?  Do all work miracles?  Do all possess gifts of healing?  Do all speak with tongues?  Do all interpret?  But earnestly desire the higher gifts.  And I will show you a still more excellent way.  If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.  If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends.",

And all were weeping and bewailing her; but he said, \"Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\" And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But taking her by the hand he called, saying, \"Child, arise.\" And her spirit returned, and she got up at once; and he directed that something should be given her to eat.

He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.\n\nSo we are always of good courage; we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, for we walk by faith, not by sight. We are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.",

I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints, and I pray that the sharing of your faith may promote the knowledge of all the good that is ours in Christ. For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you - I, Paul, an ambassador and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus - I appeal to you for my child, Onesimos, whose father I have become in my imprisonment. (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will. Perhaps this is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back for ever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, write this with my own hand, I will repay it - to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted to you.

For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you, then, be imitators of me.\n\nGospel Reading: John 1:35-51\nAt that time, John was standing with two of his disciples; and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, \"Behold, the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, \"What do you seek?\" And they said to him, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"Where are you staying?\" He said to them, \"Come and see.\" They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, \"So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas\" (which means Peter). \n\n The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, \"Follow me.\" Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, \"We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" Nathanael said to him, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Philip said to him, \"Come and see.\" Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, \"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! \" Nathanael said to him, \"How do you know me?\" Jesus answered him, \"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.\" Nathanael answered him, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!\" Jesus answered him, \"Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.\" And he said to him, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\""

For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from unchastity; that each one of you know how to take a wife for himself in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the heathen who do not know God; that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we solemnly forewarned you. For God has not called us for uncleanness, but in holiness. Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you. But concerning the love of the brethren you have no need to have any one write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another; and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout Macedonia.

Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will respect him.' But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.' And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve; he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. And they were glad, and engaged to give him money. So he agreed, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude. Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed. So he sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat it.\""

And the servant said, 'Sir, what you commanded has been done, and there is still room.' And the master said to the servant, 'Go out to the highways and hedges, and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.

And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, \"If any one would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.\"  And he took a child, and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them, \"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.\"  John said to him, \"Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he was not following us.\"  But Jesus said, \"Do not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me.  For he that is not against us is for us.  For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ, will by no means lose his reward.\""

Besides that, they learn to be idlers, gadding about from house to house, and not only idlers but gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not. So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, rule their households, and give the enemy no occasion to revile us. For some have already strayed after Satan. If any believing man or woman has relatives who are widows, let him assist them; let the church not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are real widows. Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching; for the scripture says, \"You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain,\" and, \"The laborer deserves his wages.\" Never admit any charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear.

But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.\" And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.

    "epistle": "I Timothy 5:22-25;6:1-11\nTimothy, my son, do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, nor participate in another man's sins; keep yourself pure. No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments. The sins of some men are conspicuous, pointing to judgment, but the sins of others appear later. So also good deeds are conspicuous; and even when they are not, they cannot remain hidden. Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be defamed. Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are brethren; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these duties. If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit, he knows nothing; he has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, base suspicions, and wrangling among men who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. There is great gain in godliness with contentment; for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world; but if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content. But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all evils; it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced their hearts with many pangs. But as for you, man of God, shun all this.",

But when Jesus saw it he was indignant, and said to them, \"Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\" And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon them."

When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy; and going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way."

This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, \"Out of Egypt have I called my son.\"\n\nThen Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they were no more.\" But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, \"Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.\" And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaos reigned over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. And he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\""

For a bishop, as God's steward, must be blameless; he must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of goodness, master of himself, upright, holy, and self-controlled; he must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it. For there are many insubordinate men, empty talkers and deceivers especially the circumcision party; they must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for base gain what they have no right to teach. One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, \"Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.\" This testimony is true.

And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom; and when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the company they went a day's journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances; and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him. After three days, they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions; and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, \"Son, why have you treated us so?

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.  Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.  For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\""

Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord. \n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 15:21-28\nAt that time, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried, \"Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely possessed by a demon.\" But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying,  \"Send her away, for she is crying after us.\" He answered,  \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" But she came and knelt before him, saying,  \"Lord, help me.\" And he answered,  \"It is not fair to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.\" She said,  \"Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.\" Then Jesus answered her,  \"O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.\" And her daughter was healed instantly."

When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he trusted to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.\n\nLikewise you wives, be submissive to your husbands, so that some, though they do not obey the word, may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, when they see your reverent and chaste behavior. Let not yours be the outward adorning with braiding of hair, decoration of gold, and wearing of fine clothing, but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. So once the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves and were submissive to their husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are now her children if you do right and let nothing terrify you.\n\nLikewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.\n\nFinally, all of you, have unity of spirit, sympathy, love of the brethren, a tender heart and a humble mind. Do not return evil for evil or reviling for reviling; but on the contrary bless, for to this you have been called, that you may obtain a blessing.",

The second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'

And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, \"How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? David himself, inspired by the Holy Spirit, declared,\n\n'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put your enemies under your feet.'\n\nDavid himself calls him Lord; so how is he his son?\" And the great throng heard him gladly."

I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints, and I pray that the sharing of your faith may promote the knowledge of all the good that is ours in Christ.

And he divided his living between them.  Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in loose living.  And when he had spent everything, a great famine arose in that country, and he began to be in want.  So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.  And he would gladly have filled his belly with the pods that the swine ate; and no one gave him anything.  But when he came to himself he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, but I perish here with hunger!  I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.'  And he arose and came to his father.  But while he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.  And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'  But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry; for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.'  And they began to make merry.  Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.  And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant.  And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.'  But he was angry and refused to go in.  His father came out and entreated him, but he answered his father, 'Lo, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.  But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf!'  And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.  It was fitting to make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'\""

He who confesses the Son has the Father also.  Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you.  If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father.  And this is what he has promised us, eternal life.\n\nI write this to you about those who would deceive you; but the anointing which you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that any one should teach you; as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie, just as it has taught you, abide in him.\n\nAnd now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming.  If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that every one who does right is born of him.\n\nSee what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are.  The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.  Beloved, we are God's children now; it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.  And every one who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\n\nEvery one who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him.  Little children, let no one deceive you.

If any one says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.'\"  And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door out in the open street; and they untied it.

And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him. And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover lamb, his disciples said to him, \"Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the passover?\" And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him, and wherever he enters, say to the householder, 'The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?'

For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\" And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, \"Take; this is my body.\" And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, \"This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many. Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\" And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.\" Peter said to him, \"Even though they all fall away, I will not.\" And Jesus said to him, \"Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.\" But he said vehemently, \"If I must die with you, I will not deny you.\" And they all said the same. And they went to a place which was called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, \"Sit here, while I pray.\" And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. And he said to them, \"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.\" And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, 'Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what you will.\" And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, \"Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer him. And he came the third time, and said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, \"The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard.\"  And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, \"Rabbi!\"  And he kissed him.  And they laid hands on him and seized him.  But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.  And Jesus said to them, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?  Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.  But let the scriptures be fulfilled.\"  And they all forsook him, and fled.  And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body; and they seized him, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.  And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.  And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and warming himself at the fire.  Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.  For many bore false witness against him, and their witness did not agree.  And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.'\"  Yet not even so did their testimony agree.  And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, \"Have you no answer to make?  What is it that these men testify against you?\"  But he was silent and made no answer.  Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\"  And Jesus said, \"I am; and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.\"  And the high priest tore his garments, and said, \"Why do we still need witnesses?  You have heard his blasphemy.  What is your decision?\"  And they all condemned him as deserving death.  And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him, \"Prophesy!\"  And the guards received him with blows.  And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came; and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, \"You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.\"  But he denied it, saying, \"I neither know nor understand what you mean.\"  And he went out into the gateway, and the cock crowed.  And the maid saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders, \"This man is one of them.\"  But again he denied it.  And after a little while again the bystanders said to Peter, \"Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.\"  But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, \"I do not know this man of whom you speak.\"  And immediately the cock crowed a second time.

    "gospel": "Luke 7:17-30\nAt that time, the report concerning Jesus spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country. The disciples of John told him of all these things. And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord, saying, \"Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" And when the men had come to him, they said, \"John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?'\" In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many that were blind he bestowed sight. And he answered them, \"Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.\"\n\nWhen the messengers of John had gone, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.' I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" When they heard this all the people and the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John; but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:6-15\nBrethren, it is the God who said, \"Let light shine out of darkness,\" who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us.

No greater joy can I have than this, to hear that my children follow the truth.\n\nBeloved, it is a loyal thing you do when you render any service to the brethren, especially to strangers, who have testified to your love before the church.

And not content with that, he refuses himself to welcome the brethren, and also stops those who want to welcome them and puts them out of the church.\n\nBeloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good.  He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen God.  Demetrios has testimony from every one, and from the truth itself; I testify to him too, and you know my testimony is true.\n\nI had much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink; I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face.\n\nPeace be to you.

    "gospel": "Luke 19:29-40; 22:7-39\nAt that time, when Jesus drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, saying, \"Go into the village opposite, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring it here.  If any one asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say this, 'The Lord has need of it.'\"  So those who were sent went away and found it as he had told them.  And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, \"Why are you untying the colt?\"  And they said, \"The Lord has need of it.\"  And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their garments on the colt they set Jesus upon it.  And as he rode along, they spread their garments on the road.  As he was now drawing near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying, \"Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!  Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!\"  And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, \"Teacher, rebuke your disciples.\"  He answered, \"I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.\"\n\nThen came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed.  So he sent Peter and John, saying; \"Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat it.\"  They said to him, \"Where will you have us prepare it?\"  He said to them, \"Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters, and tell the householder, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?'  And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.\"  And they went, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover.\n\nAnd when the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles with him.  And he said to them, \"I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you I shall never eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\"  And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, \"Take this, and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\"  And he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, \"This is my body which is given for you.  Do this in remembrance of me.\"  And likewise the cup after supper, saying, \"This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.  But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.  For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!\"  And they began to question one another, which of them it was that would do this.\n\nA dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.  And he said to them, \"The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors.  But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.  For which is the greater, one who sits at table, or one who serves?  Is it not the one who sits at table?  But I am among you as one who serves.\n\nYou are those who have continued with me in my trials; and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\nSimon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.\"  And he said to him, \"Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.\"  He said, \"I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you three times deny that you know me.\"\n\nAnd he said to them, \"When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?\"  They said, \"Nothing.\"  He said to them, \"But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag.  And let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy one.  For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, 'And he was reckoned with transgressors'; for what is written about me has its fulfillment.\"  And they said, \"Look, Lord, here are two swords.\"  And he said to them, \"It is enough.\"\n\nAnd he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him."

    "gospel": "Luke 23:1-31, 33, 44-56\nAt that time, the chief priests, the scribes, and elders of the people brought Jesus before Pilate.  And they began to accuse him, saying, \"We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.\"  And Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\"  And he answered him, \"You have said so.\"  And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, \"I find no crime in this man.\"  But they were urgent, saying, \"He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.\"\n\nWhen Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.  And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.  When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him.  So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer.  The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.  And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate.  And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.\n\nPilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them, \"You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him; neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us.  Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him; I will therefore chastise him and release him.\" Now he was obliged to release one man to them at the festival.\n\nBut they all cried out together, \"Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas\" -- a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder.  Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus; but they shouted out, \"Crucify, crucify him!\"  A third time he said to them, \"Why, what evil has he done?  I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.\"  But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified.  And their voices prevailed.  So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.  He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.\n\nAnd as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.  And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.  But Jesus turning to them said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.  For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck!'  Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us'; and to the hills, 'Cover us.'  For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?\"\n\nAnd when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.\n\nIt was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, while the sun's light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.  Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, \"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!\"  And having said this he breathed his last.  Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, and said, \"Certainly this man was innocent!\"  And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.  And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things.\n\nNow there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathea.  He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man, who had not consented to their purpose and deed, and he was looking for the kingdom of God.  This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.  Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him in a rock hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid.  It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.  The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid; then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.\n\nOn the sabbath they rested according to the commandment."

And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in they did not find the body.  While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel; and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, \"Why do you seek the living among the dead?  Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of man must be delivered in to the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise.\"  And they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest.

After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace; and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?' They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. And on receiving it they grumbled at the householder, saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.' But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you, and go; I choose to give to this last as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or is your eye evil because I am good?' So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.\""

And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the pride of men shall be brought low; and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.  And the idols shall utterly pass away.  And men shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.\n\nIn that day men will cast forth their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats, to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs, from before the terror of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 2:4-19\nThese are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.\n\nIn the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up -- for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground; but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground -- then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.  And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.  And out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\nA river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.  The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Hav'ilah, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.  The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Cush.  And the name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria.  And the fourth river is the Euphra'tes.\n\nThe Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.  And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, \"You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.\"\n\nThen the Lord God said, \"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.\"  So out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 3:1-18\nMy son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments; for length of days and years of life and abundant welfare will they give you.\n\nLet not loyalty and faithfulness forsake you; bind them about your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.  So you will find favor and good repute in the sight of God and man.\n\nTrust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own insight.  In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.  Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.  It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.\n\nHonor the Lord with your substance and with the first fruits of all your produce; then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.\n\nMy son, do not despise the Lord's discipline or be weary of his reproof, for the Lord reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.\n\nHappy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding, for the gain from it is better than gain from silver and its profit better than gold.  She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.  Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.  Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.  She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called happy."

So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.  Then the man said, \"This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\"  Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh.  And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.\n\nNow the serpent was more subtle than any other wild creature that the Lord God had made.  He said to the woman, \"Did God say, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden'?\"  And the woman said to the serpent, \"We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'\"  But the serpent said to the woman, \"You will not die.  For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\"  So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate.  Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.\n\nAnd they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.  But the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, \"Where are you?\"  And he said, \"I heard the sound of thee in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\"  He said, \"Who told you that you were naked?  Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?\"  The man said, \"The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.\"  Then the Lord God said to the woman, \"What is this that you have done?\"  The woman said, \"The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.\"  The Lord God said to the serpent, \"Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above all wild animals; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.  I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.\"  To the woman he said, \"I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.\"  And to Adam he said, \"Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.  In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\"\n\nThe man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 3:19-34\nThe Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens; by his knowledge the deeps broke forth, and the clouds drop down the dew.\n\nMy son, keep sound wisdom and discretion; let them not escape from your sight, and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.  Then you will walk on your way securely and your foot will not stumble.  If you sit down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.  Do not be afraid of sudden panic, or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes; for the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.  Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.\n\nDo not say to your neighbor, \"Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it\" -- when you have it with you.  Do not plan evil against your neighbor who dwells trustingly beside you.  Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.  Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways; for the perverse man is an abomination to the Lord, but the upright are in his confidence.  The Lord's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the abode of the righteous.  Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he shows favor."

And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him.  And he said to the man who had the withered hand, \"Come here.\"  And he said to them, \"Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?\"  But they were silent.  And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, \"Stretch it out,\" and his hand was restored."

While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, \"What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?\" And they stood still looking sad. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" And he said to them, \"What things?\" And they said to him, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.\" And he said to them, \"O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\" And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.\n\nSo they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further, but they constrained him, saying, \"Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So he went in to stay with them. When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished out of their sight. They said to each other, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?\" And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them, who said, \"The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!\" Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 11:24-26,32-40\nBrethren, by faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.\n\nAnd what more shall I say?

And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, every one who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem, when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.  Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy and a pavilion.  It will be for a shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.  Let me sing for my beloved a love song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.  He digged it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and he looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.  What more was there to do for my vineyard, that I have not done in it? When I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?  And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.  I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and briers and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.  For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, a cry!\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 3:21-4:7\n And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.  Then the LORD God said, \"Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever\"- therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.  He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.  \n\n Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, \"I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.\"  And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.  In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.  The LORD said to Cain, \"Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?  If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 3:34-4:22\nToward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he shows favor.  The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.\n\n  Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight; for I give you good precepts: do not forsake my teaching.  When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother, he taught me, and said to me, \"Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. Get wisdom; get insight.  Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.  The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.  Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.  She will place on your head a fair garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown.\"\n\n  Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.  I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.  When you walk, your step will not be hampered; and if you run, you will not stumble.  Keep hold of instruction, do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.  Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evil men.  Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.  For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made some one stumble.  For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.  But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.  The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.\n\n  My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.  Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart."

Woe to those who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is no more room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land.

The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.  And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.  When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.\"  Cain said to the LORD, \"My punishment is greater than I can bear.  Behold, thou hast driven me this day away from the ground; and from thy face I shall be hidden; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will slay me.\"  Then the LORD said to him, \"Not so! If any one slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.\" And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who came upon him should kill him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 5:1-15\nMy son, be attentive to my wisdom, incline your ear to my understanding; that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.

Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house; lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless; lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of an alien; and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed, and you say, \"How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!

To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.  And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.  Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.  His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.  Zillah bore Tubalcain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.  Lamech said to his wives: \"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, hearken to what I say: I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.  If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold.\" \n\n  And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, \"God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.\"  To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh.

Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely hind, a graceful doe. Let her affection fill you at all times with delight, be infatuated always with her love.  Why should you be infatuated, my son, with a loose woman and embrace the bosom of an adventuress?  For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he watches all his paths.  The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is caught in the toils of his sin.

Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.  \n\n When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Mahalalel.  Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.  \n\n When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.  Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.  \n\n When Jared had lived a hundred and sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.  Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.  When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah.  Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.  Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.  Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 6:3-20\nThen do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into your neighbor's power: go, hasten, and importune your neighbor.  Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber; save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.\n\n  Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.  Without having any chief, officer or ruler, she prepares her food in summer, and gathers her sustenance in harvest.  How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?  A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a vagabond, and want like an armed man.  A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, winks with his eyes, scrapes with his feet, points with his finger, with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord; therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.\n\n  There are six things which the LORD hates, seven which are an abomination to him:  haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and a man who sows discord among brothers.  My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching."

When the house of David was told, \"Syria is in league with Ephraim,\" his heart and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.\n\nAnd the LORD said to Isaiah, \"Go forth to meet Ahaz, you and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field, and say to him, 'Take heed, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah.  Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying,  \"Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,\" thus says the Lord GOD: It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.  For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. (Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.)  And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.'\"\n\nAgain the LORD spoke to Ahaz,  \"Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.\"  But Ahaz said, \"I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.\"  And he said, \"Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?  Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 5:32-6:8\n After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  When men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took to wife such of them as they chose.  Then the LORD said, \"My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for he is flesh, but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.\"  The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.  \n\n The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  And the LORD was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.  So the LORD said, \"I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, man and beast and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.\"  But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 6:20-7:1\nMy son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.  Bind them upon your heart always; tie them about your neck.  When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.  For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life, to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adventuress.  Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes; for a harlot may be hired for a loaf of bread, but an adulteress stalks a man's very life.  Can a man carry fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned?  Or can one walk upon hot coals and his feet not be scorched?  So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.  Do not men despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry?  And if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.  He who commits adultery has no sense; he who does it destroys himself.  Wounds and dishonor will he get, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.  For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.  He will accept no compensation, nor be appeased though you multiply gifts.  My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you."

And a leper came to him beseeching him, and kneeling said to him, \"If you will, you can make me clean.\" Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, \"I will; be clean.\" And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.

And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, not even about the door; and he was preaching the word to them. And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and when they had made an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic lay. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"My son, your sins are forgiven.\" Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, \"Why does this man speak thus? It is a blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, \"Why do you question thus in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your pallet and walk? But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"-he said to the paralytic-\"I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.\" And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, \"We never saw anything like this!\""

And he will become a sanctuary, and a stone of offense, and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  And many shall stumble thereon; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.\"  \n\n Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples.  I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.  Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.  And when they say to you, \"Consult the mediums and the wizards who chirp and mutter,\" should not a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?  To the teaching and to the testimony! Surely for this word which they speak there is no dawn.  They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry; and when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will curse their king and their God, and turn their faces upward; and they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be thrust into thick darkness.  \n\n But there will be no gloom for her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.  The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shined.  Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased its joy; they rejoice before thee as with joy at the harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.  For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as on the day of Midian.  For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government will be upon his shoulder, and his name will be called \"Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\"  Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and for evermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 6:9-22\n These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.  And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.  And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.  And God said to Noah, \"I have determined to make an end of all flesh; for the earth is filled with violence through them; behold, I will destroy them with the earth.  Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.  This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.  Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and set the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks.  For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall die.  But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.  And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.  Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you, to keep them alive.  Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them.\"  Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 8:1-21\nDoes not wisdom call, does not understanding raise her voice? On the heights beside the way, in the paths she takes her stand; beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:  \"To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the sons of men.O simple ones, learn prudence; O foolish men, pay attention.  Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right; for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.  They are all straight to him who understands and right to those who find knowledge.  Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold; for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.  I, wisdom, dwell in prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.  The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.  I have counsel and sound wisdom, I have insight, I have strength.  By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just; by me princes rule, and nobles govern the earth.  I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.  Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and prosperity.  My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.  I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice, endowing with wealth those who love me, and filling their treasuries."

The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.  The people did not turn to him who smote them, nor seek the LORD of hosts.  So the LORD cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed in one day - the elder and honored man is the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail; for those who lead this people lead them astray, and those who are led by them are swallowed up.  Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men, and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is godless and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.  For wickedness burns like a fire, it consumes briers and thorns; it kindles the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.  Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts the land is burned, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no man spares his brother.  They snatch on the right, but are still hungry, and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied; each devours his neighbor's flesh, Manasseh, Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh, and together they are against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.  \n\n Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and the writers who keep writing oppression, to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!  What will you do on the day of punishment, in the storm which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth?  Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 7:1-5\n Then the LORD said to Noah, \"Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.  Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate; and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive upon the face of all the earth.  For in seven days I will send rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.\"  And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 8:32-9:11\nAnd now, my sons, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways.  Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.  Happy is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.  For he who finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD; but he who misses me injures himself; all who hate me love death.\"  Wisdom has built her house, she has set up her seven pillars.  She has slaughtered her beasts, she has mixed her wine, she has also set her table.  She has sent out her maids to call from the highest places in the town,  \"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!\" To him who is without sense she says,  \"Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.  Leave simpleness, and live, and walk in the way of insight.\"  He who corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.  Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you.  Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man and he will increase in learning.  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.  For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life. "

A foolish woman is noisy; she is wanton and knows no shame.  She sits at the door of her house, she takes a seat on the high places of the town, calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way,  \"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!\" And to him who is without sense she says,  \"Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.\"  But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol."

And there will be a highway from Assyria for the remnant which is left of his people, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.  \n\n You will say in that day: \"I will give thanks to thee, O LORD, for though thou wast angry with me, thy anger turned away, and thou didst comfort me.  \"Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 7:11-8:3\n In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.  And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.  On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark, they and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, every bird of every sort.  They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.  And they that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.  \n\n The flood continued forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.  The waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.  And the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered; the waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, birds, cattle, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth, and every man; everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.  He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.  And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.  But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided; the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained, and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters had abated.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 10:1-22\nA wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.  Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit, but righteousness delivers from death.  The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.  A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.  A son who gathers in summer is prudent, but a son who sleeps in harvest brings shame.  Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.  The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot.  The wise of heart will heed commandments, but a prating fool will come to ruin.  He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.  He who winks the eye causes trouble, but he who boldly reproves makes peace.  The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.  Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses.  On the lips of him who has understanding wisdom is found, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense.  Wise men lay up knowledge, but the babbling of a fool brings ruin near.  A rich man's wealth is his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin.  The wage of the righteous leads to life, the gain of the wicked to sin.  He who heeds instruction is on the path to life, but he who rejects reproof goes astray.  He who conceals hatred has lying lips, and he who utters slander is a fool.  When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but he who restrains his lips is prudent.  The tongue of the righteous is choice silver; the mind of the wicked is of little worth.  The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of sense.  The blessing of the LORD makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it."

And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry, \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.

And he came to her and said, \"Hail, O favored one, the Lord is with you! Blessed are you among women!\" But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.\" And Mary said to the angel, \"How shall this be, since I have no husband?\" And the angel said to her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.\n\nAnd behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.

It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will. For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. It has been testified somewhere, \"What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man, that thou carest for him? Thou didst make him for a little while lower than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet.\" Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one. For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.",

Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, \"I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.\""

They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying, and the napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.

For the LORD of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it? His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?  In the year that King Ahaz died came this oracle:  \"Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of you, that the rod which smote you is broken, for from the serpent's root will come forth an adder, and its fruit will be a flying serpent.  And the first-born of the poor will feed, and the needy lie down in safety; but I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant I will slay.  Wail, O gate; cry, O city; melt in fear, O Philistia, all of you! For smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.\"  What will one answer the messengers of the nation? \"The LORD has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his people find refuge.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 8:21-9:7\n And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor, the LORD said in his heart, \"I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.  While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.\"  \n\n And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, \"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.  The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the air, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.  Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.  Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.  For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning; of every beast I will require it and of man; of every man's brother I will require the life of man.  Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man in his own image.  And you, be fruitful and multiply, bring forth abundantly on the earth and multiply in it.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 11:19-12:6\nHe who is steadfast in righteousness will live, but he who pursues evil will die.  Men of perverse mind are an abomination to the LORD, but those of blameless ways are his delight.  Be assured, an evil man will not go unpunished, but those who are righteous will be delivered.  Like a gold ring in a swine's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion.  The desire of the righteous ends only in good; the expectation of the wicked in wrath.  One man gives freely, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should give, and only suffers want.  A liberal man will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered.  The people curse him who holds back grain, but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it.  He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but evil comes to him who searches for it.  He who trusts in his riches will wither, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.  He who troubles his household will inherit wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise.  The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, but lawlessness takes away lives.  If the righteous is requited on earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner!  Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid.  A good man obtains favor from the LORD, but a man of evil devices he condemns.  A man is not established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous will never be moved.  A good wife is the crown of her husband, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.  The thoughts of the righteous are just; the counsels of the wicked are treacherous.  The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright delivers men."

For thou hast made the city a heap, the fortified city a ruin; the palace of aliens is a city no more, it will never be rebuilt.  Therefore strong peoples will glorify thee; cities of ruthless nations will fear thee.  For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat; for the blast of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall, like heat in a dry place.

I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.\"  And God said, \"This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:  I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.  When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.  When the bow is in the clouds, I will look upon it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.\"  God said to Noah, \"This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 12:8-22\nA man is commended according to his good sense, but one of perverse mind is despised.  Better is a man of humble standing who works for himself than one who plays the great man but lacks bread.  A righteous man has regard for the life of his beast, but the mercy of the wicked is cruel.  He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits has no sense.  The strong tower of the wicked comes to ruin, but the root of the righteous stands firm.  An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips, but the righteous escapes from trouble.  From the fruit of his words a man is satisfied with good, and the work of a man's hand comes back to him.  The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice.  The vexation of a fool is known at once, but the prudent man ignores an insult.  He who speaks the truth gives honest evidence, but a false witness utters deceit.  There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.  Truthful lips endure for ever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment.  Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, but those who plan good have joy.  No ill befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with trouble.  Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, but those who act faithfully are his delight."

Ham was the father of Canaan.  These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled.\n\nNoah was the first tiller of the soil. He planted a vineyard; and he drank of the wine, and became drunk, and lay uncovered in his tent.  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.  Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it upon both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness.  When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him, he said, \"Cursed be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers.\"  He also said, \"Blessed by the LORD my God be Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.  God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.\"  After the flood Noah lived three hundred and fifty years.  All the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.  These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; sons were born to them after the flood.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 12:23-13:9\nA prudent man conceals his knowledge, but fools proclaim their folly.  The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor.  Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad.  A righteous man turns away from evil, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.  A slothful man will not catch his prey, but the diligent man will get precious wealth.  In the path of righteousness is life, but the way of error leads to death.  A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.  From the fruit of his mouth a good man eats good, but the desire of the treacherous is for violence.  He who guards his mouth preserves his life; he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.  The soul of the sluggard craves, and gets nothing, while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.  A righteous man hates falsehood, but a wicked man acts shamefully and disgracefully.  Righteousness guards him whose way is upright, but sin overthrows the wicked.  One man pretends to be rich, yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.  The ransom of a man's life is his wealth, but a poor man has no means of redemption.  The light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked will be put out."

As often as it passes through it will take you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.  For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in it.  For the LORD will rise up as on Mount Perazim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; to do his deed - strange is his deed! and to work his work - alien is his work!  Now therefore do not scoff, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord GOD of hosts upon the whole land.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 10:32-11:9\n These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.  Now the whole earth had one language and few words.  And as men migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.  And they said to one another, \"Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.\" And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.  Then they said, \"Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\"  And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of men had built.  And the LORD said, \"Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.  Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.\"  So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.  Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 13:19-14:6\nA desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul; but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools.  He who walks with wise men becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.  Misfortune pursues sinners, but prosperity rewards the righteous.  A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous.  The fallow ground of the poor yields much food, but it is swept away through injustice.  He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.  The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the wicked suffers want.  Wisdom builds her house, but folly with her own hands tears it down.  He who walks in uprightness fears the LORD, but he who is devious in his ways despises him.  The talk of a fool is a rod for his back, but the lips of the wise will preserve them.  Where there are no oxen, there is no grain; but abundant crops come by the strength of the ox.  A faithful witness does not lie, but a false witness breathes out lies.  A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain, but knowledge is easy for a man of understanding."

Who knows us?\"  You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay; that the thing made should say of its maker, \"He did not make me\"; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, \"He has no understanding\"?  \n\n Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?  In that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.  The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.  For the ruthless shall come to nought and the scoffer cease, and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off, who by a word make a man out to be an offender, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right.  \n\n Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: \"Jacob shall no more be ashamed, no more shall his face grow pale.  For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 12:1-7\n Now the LORD said to Abram, \"Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.  And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.  I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves.\"  \n\n So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions which they had gathered, and the persons that they had gotten in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan, Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.  Then the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, \"To your descendants I will give this land.\" So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 14:15-26\nThe simple believes everything, but the prudent looks where he is going.  A wise man is cautious and turns away from evil, but a fool throws off restraint and is careless.  A man of quick temper acts foolishly, but a man of discretion is patient.  The simple acquire folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.  The evil bow down before the good, the wicked at the gates of the righteous.  The poor is disliked even by his neighbor, but the rich has many friends.  He who despises his neighbor is a sinner, but happy is he who is kind to the poor.  Do they not err that devise evil? Those who devise good meet loyalty and faithfulness.  In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to want.  The crown of the wise is their wisdom, but folly is the garland of fools.  A truthful witness saves lives, but one who utters lies is a betrayer.  In the fear of the LORD one has strong confidence, and his children will have a refuge."

    "gospel": "John 20:11-18\nAt that time, Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet.  They said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping?\"  She said to them, \"Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.\"  Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.  Jesus said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?\"  Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him, \"Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away.\"  Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\"  She turned and said to him in Hebrew, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher).  Jesus said to her, \"Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.\"  Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, \"I have seen the Lord\"; and she told them that He had said these things to her.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 6:13-20\nBRETHREN, when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore to himself, saying, \"Surely I will bless you and multiply you.\" And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.

How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.\" And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. And Jesus asked his father, \"How long has he had this?\" And he said, \"From childhood. And it has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.\" And Jesus said to him, \"If you can! All things are possible to him who believes.\" Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, \"I believe; help my unbelief!\" And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, \"You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.\" And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said, \"He is dead.\" But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, \"Why could we not cast it out?\" And he said to them, \"This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting.\" They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would not have any one know it; for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, \"The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.\""

By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, says the LORD.  For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David.\"  And the angel of the LORD went forth, and slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.  Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went home and dwelt at Nineveh.  And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, slew him with the sword, and escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. \n\n  In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, \"Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order; for you shall die, you shall not recover.\"  Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, and said, \"Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in thy sight.\" And Hezekiah wept bitterly.  Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:  \"Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.  I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and defend this city.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 13:12-18\n Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, while Lot dwelt among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.  Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.  \n\n The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, \"Lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward; for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants for ever.  I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your descendants also can be counted.  Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.\"  So Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the LORD.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 14:27-15:4\nThe fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, that one may avoid the snares of death.  In a multitude of people is the glory of a king, but without people a prince is ruined.  He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly.  A tranquil mind gives life to the flesh, but passion makes the bones rot.  He who oppresses a poor man insults his Maker, but he who is kind to the needy honors him.  The wicked is overthrown through his evil-doing, but the righteous finds refuge through his integrity.  Wisdom abides in the mind of a man of understanding, but it is not known in the heart of fools.  Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.  A servant who deals wisely has the king's favor, but his wrath falls on one who acts shamefully.  A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.  The tongue of the wise dispenses knowledge, but the mouths of fools pour out folly.  The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.  A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it breaks the spirit."

The idol! a workman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts for it silver chains.  He who is impoverished chooses for an offering wood that will not rot; he seeks out a skilful craftsman to set up an image that will not move.  \n\n Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?  It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in; who brings princes to nought, and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.  \n\n Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth, when he blows upon them, and they wither, and the tempest carries them off like stubble.  \n\n To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? Says the Holy One.  Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power not one is missing.  \n\n Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, \"My way is hid from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God\"?  Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary, his understanding is unsearchable.  He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength.  Even youths shall faint and be weary, and young men shall fall exhausted; but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 15:1-15\n After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, \"Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.\"  But Abram said, \"O Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\"  And Abram said, \"Behold, thou hast given me no offspring; and a slave born in my house will be my heir.\"  And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, \"This man shall not be your heir; your own son shall be your heir.\"  And he brought him outside and said, \"Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.\" Then he said to him, \"So shall your descendants be.\"  And he believed the LORD; and he reckoned it to him as righteousness.  \n\n And he said to him, \"I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.\"  But he said, \"O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?\"  He said to him, \"Bring me a heifer three years old, a she-goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\"  And he brought him all these, cut them in two, and laid each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two.  And when birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away.  \n\n As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram; and lo, a dread and great darkness fell upon him.  Then the LORD said to Abram, \"Know of a surety that your descendants will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and will be slaves there, and they will be oppressed for four hundred years; but I will bring judgment on the nation which they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.  As for yourself, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 15:7-19\nThe lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so the minds of fools.  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, but the prayer of the upright is his delight.  The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, but he loves him who pursues righteousness.  There is severe discipline for him who forsakes the way; he who hates reproof will die.  Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the LORD, how much more the hearts of men!  A scoffer does not like to be reproved; he will not go to the wise.  A glad heart makes a cheerful countenance, but by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.  The mind of him who has understanding seeks knowledge, but the mouths of fools feed on folly.  All the days of the afflicted are evil, but a cheerful heart has a continual feast.  Better is a little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble with it.  Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a fatted ox and hatred with it.  A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, but he who is slow to anger quiets contention.  The way of a sluggard is overgrown with thorns, but the path of the upright is a level highway."

I, the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am He.  The coastlands have seen and are afraid, the ends of the earth tremble; they have drawn near and come.  Every one helps his neighbor, and says to his brother, \"Take courage!\"  The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, and he who smoothes with the hammer him who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, \"It is good\"; and they fasten it with nails so that it cannot be moved.  \n\n But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend; you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, \"You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off\"; fear not, for I am with you, be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand. \n\n  Behold, all who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.  You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.

I will help you, says the LORD; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 17:1-9\n When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, \"I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.  And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.\"  Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him,  \"Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.  No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.  I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you.  And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you.  And I will give to you, and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 15:20-16:9\nA wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish man despises his mother.  Folly is a joy to him who has no sense, but a man of understanding walks aright.  Without counsel plans go wrong, but with many advisers they succeed.  To make an apt answer is a joy to a man, and a word in season, how good it is!  The wise man's path leads upward to life, that he may avoid Sheol beneath.  The LORD tears down the house of the proud, but maintains the widow's boundaries.  The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD, the words of the pure are pleasing to him.  He who is greedy for unjust gain makes trouble for his household, but he who hates bribes will live.  The mind of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.  The LORD is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.  The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and good news refreshes the bones.  He whose ear heeds wholesome admonition will abide among the wise.  He who ignores instruction despises himself, but he who heeds admonition gains understanding.  The fear of the LORD is instruction in wisdom, and humility goes before honor.  The plans of the mind belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.  All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the spirit.  Commit your work to the LORD, and your plans will be established.  The LORD has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble.  Every one who is arrogant is an abomination to the LORD; be assured, he will not go unpunished.  By loyalty and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the LORD a man avoids evil.  When a man's ways please the LORD, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.  Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice.  A man's mind plans his way, but the LORD directs his steps."

Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.\" \n\n  Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the end of the earth! Let the sea roar and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants.  Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the top of the mountains.  Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands.  The LORD goes forth like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his fury; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes. \n\n  For a long time I have held my peace, I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in travail, I will gasp and pant.  I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbage; I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools.  And I will lead the blind in a way that they know not, in paths that they have not known I will guide them. I will turn the darkness before them into light, the rough places into level ground. These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 18:20-33\n Then the LORD said, \"Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry which has come to me; and if not, I will know.\"  So the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham still stood before the LORD.  Then Abraham drew near, and said, \"Wilt thou indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?  Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?  Far be it from thee to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\"  And the LORD said, \"If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.\"  Abraham answered, \"Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.  Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Wilt thou destroy the whole city for lack of five?\" And he said, \"I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.\"  Again he spoke to him, and said, \"Suppose forty are found there.\" He answered, \"For the sake of forty I will not do it.\"  Then he said, \"Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.\" He answered, \"I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\"  He said, \"Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.\" He answered, \"For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.\"  Then he said, \"Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.\" He answered, \"For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.\"  And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 16:17-17:17\nThe highway of the upright turns aside from evil; he who guards his way preserves his life.  Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.  It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide the spoil with the proud.  He who gives heed to the word will prosper, and happy is he who trusts in the LORD.  The wise of heart is called a man of discernment, and pleasant speech increases persuasiveness.  Wisdom is a fountain of life to him who has it, but folly is the chastisement of fools.  The mind of the wise makes his speech judicious, and adds persuasiveness to his lips.  Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.  There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.  A worker's appetite works for him; his mouth urges him on.  A worthless man plots evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire.  A perverse man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends.  A man of violence entices his neighbor and leads him in a way that is not good.  He who winks his eyes plans perverse things, he who compresses his lips brings evil to pass.  A hoary head is a crown of glory; it is gained in a righteous life.  He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.  The lot is cast into the lap, but the decision is wholly from the LORD.\n\n  Better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife.  A slave who deals wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully, and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers.  The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, and the LORD tries hearts.  An evildoer listens to wicked lips; and a liar gives heed to a mischievous tongue.  He who mocks the poor insults his Maker; he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished.  Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of sons is their fathers.  Fine speech is not becoming to a fool; still less is false speech to a prince.  A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of him who gives it; wherever he turns he prospers.  He who forgives an offense seeks love, but he who repeats a matter alienates a friend.  A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred blows into a fool.  An evil man seeks only rebellion, and a cruel messenger will be sent against him.  Let a man meet a she-bear robbed of her cubs, rather than a fool in his folly.  If a man returns evil for good, evil will not depart from his house.  The beginning of strife is like letting out water; so quit before the quarrel breaks out.  He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination to the LORD.  Why should a fool have a price in his hand to buy wisdom, when he has no mind?  A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity."

I made the earth, and created man upon it; it was my hands that stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.  I have aroused him in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build my city and set my exiles free, not for price or reward,\" says the LORD of hosts.  \n\n Thus says the LORD: \"The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you and be yours, they shall follow you; they shall come over in chains and bow down to you. They will make supplication to you, saying: 'God is with you only, and there is no other, no god besides him.'\"  Truly, thou art a God who hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior.  All of them are put to shame and confounded, the makers of idols go in confusion together.  But Israel is saved by the LORD with everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 22:1-18\n After these things God tested Abraham, and said to him, \"Abraham!\" And he said, \"Here am I.\"  He said, \"Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.\"  So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; and he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.  On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.  Then Abraham said to his young men, \"Stay here with the ass; I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\"  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.  And Isaac said to his father Abraham, \"My father! \"And he said, \"Here am I, my son.\" He said, \"Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\"  Abraham said, \"God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.\" So they went both of them together.  \n\n When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.  Then Abraham put forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.  But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" And he said, \"Here am I.\"  He said, \"Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.\"  And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.  So Abraham called the name of that place The LORD will provide; as it is said to this day, \"On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.\"  And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said, \"By myself I have sworn, says the LORD, because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will indeed bless you, and I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies, and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 17:17-18:5\nA friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.  A man without sense gives a pledge, and becomes surety in the presence of his neighbor.  He who loves transgression loves strife; he who makes his door high seeks destruction.  A man of crooked mind does not prosper, and one with a perverse tongue falls into calamity.  A stupid son is a grief to a father; and the father of a fool has no joy.  A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a downcast spirit dries up the bones.  A wicked man accepts a bribe from the bosom to pervert the ways of justice.  A man of understanding sets his face toward wisdom, but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.  A foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him.  To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good; to flog noble men is wrong.  He who restrains his words has knowledge, and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.  Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise; when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent.\n\n  He who is estranged seeks pretexts to break out against all sound judgment.  A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion.  When wickedness comes, contempt comes also; and with dishonor comes disgrace.  The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a gushing stream.  It is not good to be partial to a wicked man, or to deprive a righteous man of justice."

For a tent was prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.

And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n  And Mary said, \"My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home."

    "gospel": "John 20:19-31\nOn the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them: \"Peace be with you.\"  When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.  Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.  Jesus said to them again, \"Peace be with you.  As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.\"  And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them: \"Receive the Holy Spirit.  If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\"\n\nNow Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.  So the other disciples told him: \"We have seen the Lord.\" But he said to them: \"Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe.\"\n\nEight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them.  The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said: \"Peace be with you.\"  Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but believing.\"  Thomas answered him, \"My Lord and my God!\" Jesus said to him, \"Have you believed because you have seen me?  Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\"\n\nNow Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\n\nEpistle Reading: Hebrews 9:11-14\nBRETHREN, when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood of goats and calves but his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.

Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\" And they said to him, \"We are able.\" And Jesus said to them, \"The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\" And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant of James and John. And Jesus called them to him and said to them, \"You know that those who are supposed to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\""

O that you had hearkened to my commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea; your offspring would have been like the sand, and your descendants like its grains; their name would never be cut off or destroyed from before me.\"\n\nGo forth from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it, send it forth to the end of the earth; say, \"The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!\"  They thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he cleft the rock and the water gushed out.  \"There is no peace,\" says the LORD, \"for the wicked.\"\n\nListen to me, O coastlands, and hearken, you peoples from afar. The LORD called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name.  He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away.  And he said to me, \"You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.\"  But I said, \"I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my right is with the LORD, and my recompense with my God.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 27:1-41\nWhen Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son, and said to him, \"My son\"; and he answered, \"Here I am.\"  He said, \"Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.  Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me, and prepare for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat; that I may bless you before I die.\"  Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \"I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,  'Bring me game, and prepare for me savory food, that I may eat it, and bless you before the LORD before I die.'  Now therefore, my son, obey my word as I command you.  Go to the flock, and fetch me two good kids, that I may prepare from them savory food for your father, such as he loves; and you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.\"  But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, \"Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.  Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.\"  His mother said to him, \"Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my word, and go, fetch them to me.\"  So he went and took them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savory food, such as his father loved.  Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son; and the skins of the kids she put upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck; and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n\nSo he went in to his father, and said, \"My father\"; and he said, \"Here I am; who are you, my son?\"  Jacob said to his father, \"I am Esau your first-born. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that you may bless me.\"  But Isaac said to his son, \"How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?\" He answered, \"Because the LORD your God granted me success.\"  Then Isaac said to Jacob, \"Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.\"  So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, \"The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\"  And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.  He said, \"Are you really my son Esau?\" He answered, \"I am.\"  Then he said, \"Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you.\" So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.  Then his father Isaac said to him, \"Come near and kiss me, my son.\"  So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, \"See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed!  May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine.  Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be every one who curses you, and blessed be every one who blesses you!\"\n\nAs soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  He also prepared savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, \"Let my father arise, and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me.\"  His father Isaac said to him, \"Who are you?\" He answered, \"I am your son, your first-born, Esau.\"  Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, \"Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? - Yes, and he shall be blessed.\"  When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, \"Bless me, even me also, O my father!\"  But he said, \"Your brother came with guile, and he has taken away your blessing.\"  Esau said, \"Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright; and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.\" Then he said, \"Have you not reserved a blessing for me?\"  Isaac answered Esau, \"Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?\"  Esau said to his father, \"Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.\" And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.  Then Isaac his father answered him: \"Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven on high.  By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you break loose you shall break his yoke from your neck.\"  Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, \"The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 19:16-25\nHe who keeps the commandment keeps his life; he who despises the word will die.  He who is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will repay him for his deed.  Discipline your son while there is hope; do not set your heart on his destruction.  A man of great wrath will pay the penalty; for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again.  Listen to advice and accept instruction, that you may gain wisdom for the future.  Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be established.  What is desired in a man is loyalty, and a poor man is better than a liar.  The fear of the LORD leads to life; and he who has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm.  The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, and will not even bring it back to his mouth.  Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove a man of understanding, and he will gain knowledge."

They shall feed along the ways, on all bare heights shall be their pasture; they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall smite them, for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 31:3-16\n Then the LORD said to Jacob, \"Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.\"  So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was, and said to them, \"I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.  You know that I have served your father with all my strength; yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me.  If he said, 'The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped.  Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.  In the mating season of the flock I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream that the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.  Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!'  And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that leap upon the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.  I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go forth from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'\"  Then Rachel and Leah answered him, \"Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?  Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has been using up the money given for us.  All the property which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children; now then, whatever God has said to you, do.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 21:3-21\nTo do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.  Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin.  The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but every one who is hasty comes only to want.  The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death.  The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, because they refuse to do what is just.  The way of the guilty is crooked, but the conduct of the pure is right.  It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a contentious woman.  The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.  When a scoffer is punished, the simple becomes wise; when a wise man is instructed, he gains knowledge.  The righteous observes the house of the wicked; the wicked are cast down to ruin.  He who closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself cry out and not be heard.  A gift in secret averts anger; and a bribe in the bosom, strong wrath.  When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous, but dismay to evildoers.  A man who wanders from the way of understanding will rest in the assembly of the dead.  He who loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.  The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, and the faithless for the upright.  It is better to live in a desert land than with a contentious and fretful woman.  Precious treasure remains in a wise man's dwelling, but a foolish man devours it.  He who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life and honor."

Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that did righteousness and did not forsake the ordinance of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God.  'Why have we fasted, and thou seest it not? Why have we humbled ourselves, and thou takest no knowledge of it?' Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, and oppress all your workers.  Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with wicked fist. Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high.  Is such the fast that I choose, a day for a man to humble himself? Is it to bow down his head like a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the LORD?  \n\n \"Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?  Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?  Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up speedily; your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.  Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, \"Here I am.\" \n\n \"If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness, if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.  And the LORD will guide you continually, and satisfy your desire with good things, and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 43:26-31; 45:1-16\n When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which they had with them, and bowed down to him to the ground.  And he inquired about their welfare, and said, \"Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?\"  They said, \"Your servant our father is well, he is still alive.\" And they bowed their heads and made obeisance.  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, \"Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!\"  Then Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there.  Then he washed his face and came out; and controlling himself he said, \"Let food be served.\" \n\n (Chapter 45:1-16) Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him; and he cried, \"Make every one go out from me.\" So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.  And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.  And Joseph said to his brothers, \"I am Joseph; is my father still alive?\" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.  So Joseph said to his brothers, \"Come near to me, I pray you.\" And they came near. And he said, \"I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.  And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.  For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.  And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.  So it was not you who sent me here, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.  Make haste and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry; you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have; and there I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come; lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.'  And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.  You must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Make haste and bring my father down here.\"  Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.  And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.  When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, \"Joseph's brothers have come,\" it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 21:23-22:4\nHe who keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps himself out of trouble.  \"Scoffer\" is the name of the proud, haughty man who acts with arrogant pride.  The desire of the sluggard kills him for his hands refuse to labor.  All day long the wicked covets, but the righteous gives and does not hold back.  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent.  A false witness will perish, but the word of a man who hears will endure.  A wicked man puts on a bold face, but an upright man considers his ways.  No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel, can avail against the LORD.  The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the LORD.  A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver or gold.  The rich and the poor meet together; the LORD is the maker of them all.  A prudent man sees danger and hides himself; but the simple go on, and suffer for it.  The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honor and life."

I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah inheritors of my mountains; my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.  Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for my people who have sought me.  But you who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny; I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter; because, when I called, you did not answer, when I spoke, you did not listen, but you did what was evil in my eyes, and chose what I did not delight in.\"  Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: \"Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame; behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, but you shall cry out for pain of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.  You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse, and the Lord GOD will slay you; but his servants he will call by a different name.  So that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth, and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hid from my eyes.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 46:1-7\n So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.  And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night, and said, \"Jacob, Jacob.\" And he said, \"Here am I.\"  Then he said, \"I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation.  I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again; and Joseph's hand shall close your eyes.\"  Then Jacob set out from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.  They also took their cattle and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him, his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters; all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 23:15-24:5\nMy son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will be glad.  My soul will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.  Let not your heart envy sinners, but continue in the fear of the LORD all the day.  Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.  Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your mind in the way.  Be not among winebibbers, or among gluttonous eaters of meat; for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.  Hearken to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.  Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding.  The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who begets a wise son will be glad in him.  Let your father and mother be glad, let her who bore you rejoice.  My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.  For a harlot is a deep pit; an adventuress is a narrow well.  She lies in wait like a robber and increases the faithless among men.  Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?  Those who tarry long over wine, those who go to try mixed wine.  Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.  At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.  Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind utter perverse things.  You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast.  \"They struck me,\" you will say, \"but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I will seek another drink.\"  Be not envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them; for their minds devise violence, and their lips talk of mischief.  By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.  A wise man is mightier than a strong man, and a man of knowledge than he who has strength."

As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.  You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like the grass; and it shall be known that the hand of the LORD is with his servants, and his indignation is against his enemies.  \"For behold, the LORD will come in fire, and his chariots like the stormwind, to render his anger in fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.  For by fire will the LORD execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many.  \"Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating swine's flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, says the LORD.  \"For I know their works and their thoughts, and I am coming to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and shall see my glory, and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands afar off, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.  And they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their cereal offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.  And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.  \"For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me, says the LORD; so shall your descendants and your name remain.  From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says the LORD.  \"And they shall go forth and look on the dead bodies of the men that have rebelled against me; for their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.\"\n\nOld Testament Reading: Genesis 49:33-50:26\nWhen Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed, and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.  Then Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept over him, and kissed him.  And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel; forty days were required for it, for so many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.\n\nAnd when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, My father made me swear, saying, 'I am about to die: in my tomb which I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.' Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father; then I will return.\"  And Pharaoh answered, \"Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.\"  So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.  And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; it was a very great company.  When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.  When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, \"This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.\" Therefore the place was named Abelmizraim; it is beyond the Jordan.  Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them; for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite, to possess as a burying place.  After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.  When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, \"It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.\"  So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, \"Your father gave this command before he died,  'Say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.' And now, we pray you, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.\" Joseph wept when they spoke to him.  His brothers also came and fell down before him, and said, \"Behold, we are your servants.\"  But Joseph said to them, \"Fear not, for am I in the place of God?  As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.  So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.\" Thus he reassured them and comforted them.\n\nSo Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.  And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.  And Joseph said to his brothers, \"I am about to die; but God will visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\"  Then Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, \"God will visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.\"  So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n\nOld Testament Reading: Proverbs 31:8-31\nOpen your mouth for the dumb, for the rights of all who are left desolate.  Open your mouth, judge righteously, maintain the rights of the poor and needy.  A good wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.  The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.  She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.  She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.  She is like the ships of the merchant, she brings her food from afar.  She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and tasks for her maidens.  She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.  She girds her loins with strength and makes her arms strong.  She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.  She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.  She opens her hand to the poor, and reaches out her hands to the needy.  She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.  She makes herself coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple.  Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.  She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers girdles to the merchant.  Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.  She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.  She looks well to the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.  Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:  \"Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all.\"  Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.  Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates."

    "gospel": "John 11:1-45\nAt that time, a certain man was ill, Lazaros of Bethany, from the village of Mary and her sister Martha. It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazaros was ill. So the sisters sent to him, saying, \"Lord, he whom you love is ill.\" But when Jesus heard it he said, \"This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.\"\n\n Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazaros. So when he heard that he was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. Then after this he said to the disciples, \"Let us go into Judea again.\" The disciples said to him, \"Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?\" Jesus answered, \"Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.\" Thus he spoke, and then he said to them, \"Our friend Lazaros has fallen asleep, but I go to awake him out of sleep.\" The disciples said to him, \"Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.\" Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, \"Lazaros is dead; and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\" Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, \"Let us also go, that we may die with him.\"\n\n Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazaros had already been in the tomb four days. Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary sat in the house. Martha said to Jesus, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.\" Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise again.\" Martha said to him, \"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?\" She said to him, \"Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who is coming into the world.\"\n\n When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying quietly, \"The Teacher is here and is calling for you.\" And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\" When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled; and he said, \"Where have you laid him?\" They said to him, \"Lord, come and see.\" Jesus wept. So the Jews said, \"See how he loved him!\" But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\"\n\n Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb; it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, \"Take away the stone.\" Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, \"Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.\" Jesus said to her, \"Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?\" So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you have heard me always, but I have said this on account of the people standing by, that they may believe that you did send me.\" When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, \"Lazaros, come out.\" The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, \"Unbind him, and let him go.\" Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him."

Let all men know your forbearance. The Lord is at hand. Have no anxiety about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, do; and the God of peace will be with you. \n\nGospel Reading: John 12:1-18\nSix days before Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazaros was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. There they made him a supper; Martha served, and Lazaros was one of those at table with him. Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was to betray him), said \"Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?\" This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it. Jesus said, \"Let her alone, let her keep it for the day of my burial. The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.\"\n\n When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazaros, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazaros also to death, because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.\n\n The next day a great crowd who had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!\" And Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it; as it is written, \"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt!\" His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that this had been written of him and had been done to him. The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazaros out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness. The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign."

    "gospel": "Matthew 21:18-43\nAt that time, as Jesus was returning to the city, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, \"May no fruit ever come from you again!\" And the fig tree withered at once. When the disciples saw it they marveled, saying, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and never doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will be done. And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith. \" And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, \"By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?\" Jesus answered them, \"I also will ask you a question; and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven or from men?\" And they argued with one another, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say, 'From men,' we are afraid of the multitude; for all hold that John was a prophet.\" So they answered Jesus, \"We do not know.\" And he said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' And he answered, 'I will not'; but afterward he repented and went. And he went to the second and said the same; and he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?\" They said, \"The first.\" Jesus said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him.\n\n\"Hear another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to tenants, and went into another country. When the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to get his fruit; and the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants, more than the first; and they did the same to them. Afterward he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.' And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?\" They said to him, \"He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.\" Jesus said to them, \"Have you never read in the scriptures: 'The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 24:3-35\nAt that time, as Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, \"Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Take heed that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places: all this is but the beginning of the sufferings.\n\n Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you to death; and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. And then many will fall away, and betray one another, and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because wickedness is multiplied, most men's love will grow cold. But he who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.\n\n So when you see the desolating sacrilege spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; let him who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house; and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle. And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been shortened, no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. Then if anyone says to you, 'Lo, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. Lo, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, 'Lo, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out; if they say, 'Lo, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together. Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\n\n From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\""

    "gospel": "Matthew 22:15-46; 23:1-39\nAt that time, the Pharisees went and took counsel against Jesus, how to entangle him in his talk. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, \"Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\" But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, \"Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the money for the tax.\" And they brought him a coin. And Jesus said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" They said, \"Caesar's.\" Then he said to them, \"Render, therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. \" When they heard it, they marveled; and they left him and went away.\n\nThe same day the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question saying, \"Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother.' Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother. So too the second and third, down to the seventh. After them all, the woman died. In the resurrection, therefore, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her.\"\n\nBut Jesus answered them, \"You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven. And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.\" And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.\n\nBut when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together. And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, to test him. \"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?\" And he said to him, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.\"\n\nNow while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying: \"What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?\" They said to him, \"The son of David.\" He said to them, \"How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, 'The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, till I put your enemies under your feet'? If David thus calls him Lord, how is he his son?\" And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any one dare to ask him any more questions.\n\nThen said Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples, \"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach but do not practice. They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the market places, and being called rabbi by men, but you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brethren. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called masters, for you have one master, the Christ. He who is greatest among you shall be your servant; whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\n\n\"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves, nor allow those who would enter to go in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of Gehenna as yourselves.\n\n\"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If any one swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? And you say, 'If any one swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.' You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? So he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it; and he who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it; and he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.\n\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, justice and mercy and faith; these you ought to have done without neglecting the others. You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel! \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and rapacity. You blind Pharisee! first cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate, that the outside also may be clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like white-washed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build  the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, saying, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to Gehenna? Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation.\n\n\"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 24:36-51; 25:1-46; 26:1-2\nThe Lord said to his disciples, \"Of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but the Father only. As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Then two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left. Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\n\n\"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed,' and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eats and drinks with the drunken, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and put him with the hypocrites; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\n\n\"Then the kingdom of heaven shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them; but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, 'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' But the wise replied, 'Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. Afterward the other maidens came also, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.' But he replied, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.' Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of man shall come.\n\n\"For it will be as when a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his property; to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more. So also, he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.' His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.' And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.' His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.' He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow; so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.' But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not winnowed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.'\n\n\"When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left. Then the King will say to those at his right hand, 'Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.' Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.' Then he will say to those at his left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' Then they also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?' Then he will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.' And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\"\n\nWhen Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, \"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.\""

    "gospel": "John 12:17-50\nAt that time, the crowd that had been with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness. The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign.  The Pharisees then said to one another, \"You see that you can do nothing; look, the world has gone after him.\"\n\nNow among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.  So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, \"Sir, we wish to see Jesus.\" Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus.  And Jesus answered them, \"The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.  Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.  He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.  If any one serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me, the Father will honor him.\n\n\"Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, for this purpose I have come to this hour.  Father, glorify your name.\" Then a voice came from heaven, \"I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.\" The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, \"An angel has spoken to him.\" Jesus answered, \"This voice has come for your sake, not for mine.  Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.\"  He said this to show by what death he was to die.  The crowd answered him, \"We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?\" Jesus said to them, \"The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.\"\n\nWhen Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them. Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him;  it was that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: \"Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" Therefore they could not believe. For Isaiah again said,  \"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their heart, and turn for me to heal them.\"  Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.  Nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.\n\nAnd Jesus cried out and said, \"He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me. And he who sees me sees him who sent me.  I have come as light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.  He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day.  For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has bidden me.\"\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 26:6-16\nWhen Jesus was at Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment and she poured it on his head, as he sat at table. But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, \"Why this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for a large sum, and given to the poor.\" But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, \"Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. In pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial. Truly, I say to you wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\" Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, \"What will you give me if I deliver him to you?\" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him."

Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\n\nWhoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.

Let us, therefore, celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. (Galatians 3.13-14) Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us - for it is written, \"Cursed be everyone who hangs on a tree\" - that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",

And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Lo, I have told you.\" So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. And behold, Jesus met them and said, \"Hail!\" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.\"\n\nWhile they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sum of money to the soldiers and said, \"Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\" So they took the money and did as they were directed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.\n\nNow the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.

But God raised him up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him, 'I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will dwell in hope. For thou wilt not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let thy Holy One see corruption. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy presence.'\n\n\"Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne, he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear. For David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.' Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.\"\n\nNow when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, \"Brethren, what shall we do?\" And Peter said to them, \"Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ.\"",
    "gospel": "John 1:35-51\nAt that time, John was standing with two of his disciples; and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, \"Behold, the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, \"What do you seek?\" And they said to him, \"Rabbi\"  (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\"  He said to them, \"Come and see.\"  They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas\" (which means Peter).\n\nThe next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, \"Follow me.\"  Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, \"We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\"  Nathanael said to him, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Philip said to him, \"Come and see.\" Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, \"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\"  Nathanael said to him, \"How do you know me?\"  Jesus answered him, \"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.\"  Nathanael answered him, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!\"  Jesus answered him, \"Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.\" And he said to him, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\""

Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?\" Jesus answered, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born from above.' The Spirit blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, and you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\" Nikodemos said to him, \"How can this be?\" Jesus answered him, \"Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand this? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever.  Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings; for it is well that the heart be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited their adherents.  We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.  For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.  So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.  Therefore let us go forth to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured.  For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city which is to come.

For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself is doing; and greater works than these he will show him, that you may marvel. For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.

I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive. How can you believe, who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope. If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?\"\n\nAfter this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.

So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves entered the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.\n\nWhen they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, \"Rabbi, when did you come here?\" Jesus answered them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.

As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living. So he asked them the hour when he began to mend, and they said to him, \"Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.\" The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live\"; and he himself believed, and all his household.

But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\" And he said, \"Who are you, Lord?\" And he said, \" I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.\" The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.

And laying his hands on him he said, \"Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.\" And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight.

It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.

We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways; yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.\" With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.",
    "gospel": "John 7:14-30\nAbout the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught. The Jews marveled at it saying, \"How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?\" So Jesus answered them, \"My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me; if any man's will is to do his will, he shall know whether the teacher is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is not falsehood. Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?\" The people answered, \"You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?\" Jesus answered them, \"I did one deed, and you all marvel at it. Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath. If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man's whole body well? Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.\"\n\nSome of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, \"Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.\" So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, \"You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true, and him you do not know. I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.\" So they sought to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come."

And we are witnesses to all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and made him manifest; not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.

You judge according to the flesh, I judge no one. Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone that judge, but I and he who sent me. In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.\" They said to him therefore, \"Where is your Father?\" Jesus answered, \"You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.\" These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come."

And the believers from among the circumcised who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, \"Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?\" And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days. Now the apostles and the brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying, \"Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?\" But Peter began and explained to them in order: \"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, something descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me. Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.' But I said, 'No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' But the voice answered a second time from heaven, 'What God has cleansed you must not call common.' This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.\"",
    "gospel": "John 8:21-30\nThe Lord said to the Jews who came to him, \"I go away, and you will seek me and die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come.\" Then said the Jews, \"Will he kill himself, since he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'? \" He said to them, \"You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\" They said to him, \"Who are you?\" Jesus said to them, \"Even what I have told you from the beginning. I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\" They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.

And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.\" As he spoke thus, many believed in him."

Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?\" Jesus said to her, \"Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.\"\n\nJesus said to her, \"Go, call your husband, and come here.\" The woman answered him, \"I have no husband.\" Jesus said to her, \"You are right in saying, 'I have no husband'; for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband; this you said truly.\" The woman said to him, \"Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\" Jesus said to her, \"Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\" The woman said to him, \"I know that the Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ); when he comes, he will show us all things.\" Jesus said to her, \"I who speak to you am he.\"\n\nJust then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but none said, \"What do you wish?\" or, \"Why are you talking with her?\" So the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city and said to the people, \"Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?\" They went out of the city and were coming to him.\n\nMeanwhile the disciples besought him, saying \"Rabbi, eat.\" But he said to them, \"I have food to eat of which you do not know.\" So the disciples said to one another, \"Has anyone brought him food?\" Jesus said to them, \"My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work. Do you not say, 'There are yet four months, then comes the harvest'? I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see how the fields are already white for harvest.

I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.\"\n\nMany Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony. \"He told me all that I ever did.\" So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.

I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" When they heard this all the people and the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John; but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.\n\nEpistle Reading: II Corinthians 4:6-15\nBrethren, it is the God who said, \"Let light shine out of darkness,\" who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\n\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us.  We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.  For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us, but life in you.\n\nSince we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, \"I believed, and so I spoke,\" we too believe, and so we speak, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.  For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 11:2-15\nAt that time, when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, \"Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.\" As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those who wear soft raiment are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.' Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been coming violently and men of violence take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John; and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\""

We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless, and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become, and are now, as the refuse of the world, the off-scouring of all things. I do not write this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you, then, be imitators of me.",

To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.\n\nSo Jesus again said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.\""

And after there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to them, \"Brethren, you know that in the early days God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us; and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith. Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?

Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\"\n\nIt was the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem; it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, \"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.\" Jesus answered them, \"I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep.

Jesus answered them, \"I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?\" The Jews answered him, \"It is not for a good work that we stone you but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God.\" Jesus answered them, \"Is it not written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?' If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and scripture cannot be broken), do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?

And his disciples asked him, \"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\" Jesus answered, \"It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be made manifest in him. We must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day; night comes, when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\" As he said this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the man's eyes with the clay, saying to him, \"Go, wash in the pool of Siloam\" (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, \"Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?\" Some said, \"It is he\"; others said, \"No, but he is like him.\" He said, \"I am the man.\" They said to him, \"Then how were your eyes opened?\" He answered, \"The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash'; so I went and washed and received my sight.\" They said to him, \"Where is he?\" He said, \"I do not know.\"\n\nThey brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. The Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, \"He put clay on my eyes and I washed, and I see.\" Some of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, for he does not keep the sabbath.\" But others said, \"How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?\" There was a division among them. So they again said to the blind man, \"What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?\" He said, \"He is a prophet.\"\n\nThe Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight, and asked them, \"Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?\" His parents answered, \"We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.\" His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess him to be Christ he was to be put out of the synagogue. Therefore his parents said, \"He is of age, ask him.\"\n\nSo for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, \"Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner.\" He answered, \"Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.\" They said to him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\" He answered them, \"I have told you already and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?\" And they reviled him, saying, \"You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.\" The man answered, \"Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\" They answered him, \"You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?\" And they cast him out.\n\nJesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of man?\" He answered, \"And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?\" Jesus said to him, \"You have seen him, and it is he who speaks to you.\" He said, \"Lord, I believe\"; and he worshiped him."

And while staying with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, \"you heard from me, for John baptized with water, but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\" So when they had come together, they asked him, \"Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom of Israel?\" He said to them, \"it is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth.\" And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, and said,\"Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.\" Then they returned from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey away.",
    "gospel": "Mark 16:9-20\nWhen Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast seven demons.  She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.  But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.\n\nAfter this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.  And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.\n\nAfterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.  And he said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.  He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.  And these signs will accompany those who believe:  in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.\"\n\nSo then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.  And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it.  Amen.\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 1:1-12\nIn the first book, O Theophilos, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.

And he said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do questionings rise in your hearts? See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" And when he said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, \"Have you anything here to eat?\" They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate before them.\n\nThen he said to them, \"These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled. Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and said to them, \"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.\"\n\nThen he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him, and they returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple blessing God."

He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered up himself.

When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\" This figure Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.

Follow me!\"  So, the word went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die; but Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?\"  This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.

For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse; for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man or birds or animals or reptiles. Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever! Amen. For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions.

While you preach against stealing, do you steal? You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? For, as it is written, \"The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.\" Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?

    "epistle": "Romans 4:4-12\nBrethren, to one who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due. And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness. So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works: \"Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not reckon his sin.\" Is this blessing pronounced only upon the circumcised, or also upon the uncircumcised? We say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it reckoned to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. He received circumcision as a sign or seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them, and likewise the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but also follow the example of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.",
    "gospel": "Matthew 7:15-21\nThe Lord said, \"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits. Not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\""

    "epistle": "Romans 4:13-25\nBrethren, the promise to Abraham and his descendants, that they should inherit the world, did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression. That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants -- not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, for he is the father of us all, as it is written, \"I have made you the father of many nations\" -- in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations; as he had been told, \"So shall your descendants be.\" He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was \"reckoned to him as righteousness.\" But the words, \"it was reckoned to him,\" were written not for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him that raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification.",

    "epistle": "Romans 7:1-14\nBrethren, I am speaking to those who know the law. Do you not know that the law is binding on a person only during his life? Thus a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies she is discharged from the law concerning the husband. Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.\n\nLikewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God. While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. But now we are discharged from the law, dead to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.\n\nWhat then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet, if it had not been for the law, I should not have known sin. I should not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, \"You shall not covet.\" But sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, wrought in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law sin lies dead. I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died; the very commandment which promised life proved to be death to me. For sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me. So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.\n\nDid that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.",

And I know that this man was caught up into Paradise -- whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows -- and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses. Though if I wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for I shall be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me; but he said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.\n\nGospel Reading: Matthew 16:13-19\nAt that time, when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do men say that the Son of man is?\" And they said, \"Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" He said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" Simon Peter replied, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Jesus answered him, \"Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\""

Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear? For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows you need them all.

That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith; but that Israel who pursued the righteousness which is based on law did not succeed in fulfilling that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it through faith, but as if it were based on works.

For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, \"Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith. I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.\" And to the centurion Jesus said, \"Go; be it done for you as you have believed.\" And the servant was healed at that very moment."

For this people's heart has grown dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should perceive with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal them.' But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.\n\n\"Hear then the parable of the sower. When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the delight in riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. As for what was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit, and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\""

If the husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. But in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is.

Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen. But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Then they secretly instigated men, who said, \"We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.\" And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, and set up false witnesses who said, \"This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.\" And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.\n\nAnd the high priest said, \"Is this so?\" And Stephen said: \"Brethren and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, 'Depart from your land and from your kindred and go into the land which I will show you.' Then he departed from the land of the Chaldeans, and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living; yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him in possession and to his posterity after him, though he had no child.\n\n\"But it was Solomon who built a house for him. Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; as the prophet says, 'Heaven is my throne, and earth my footstool. What house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest? Did not my hand make all these things?'\n\n\"You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.\"\n\nNow when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth against him. But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, \"Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.\" But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.

When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. And they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty handed. Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully. And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed. He had still one other, a beloved son; finally he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' And they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others. Have you not read this scripture: 'The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?\" And they tried to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them; so they left him and went away."

No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of the demons.

For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair, but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her wear a veil.

All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.\n\nIn those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said, \"Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus. For he was numbered among us, and was allotted his share in this ministry. \"So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us -- one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.\"\n\nAnd they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justos, and Matthias. And they prayed and said, \"Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which one of these two thou hast chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place.\" And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles.",

Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\"\n\nThen Peter came up and said to him, \"Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?\" Jesus said to him, \"I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.\"\n\nNow when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan; and large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.\n\nThen children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people; but Jesus said, \"Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\" And he laid his hands on them and went away."

    "epistle": "I Corinthians 13:4-13;14:1-5\nBrethren, love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect; but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood. So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. Make love your aim, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. On the other hand, he who prophesies speaks to men for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified.",
    "gospel": "Matthew 20:1-16\nThe Lord said this parable, \"The kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace; and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?' They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. And on receiving it they grumbled at the householder, saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.' But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you, and go; I choose to give to this last as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or is your eye evil because I am good?' So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.\""

    "epistle": "I Corinthians 14:6-19\nBrethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how shall I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will any one know what is played? And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? So with yourselves; if you in a tongue utter speech that is not intelligible, how will any one know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning; but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. So with yourselves; since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excell in building up the church. Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. What am I to do? I will pray with spirit and I will sing with the mind also. Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? For you may give thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified. I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all; nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.",
    "gospel": "Matthew 20:17-28\nAt that time, as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, \"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.\"\n\nThen the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him, with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. And he said to her, \"What do you want?\" She said to him, \"Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.\" But Jesus answered, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?\" They said to him, \"We are able.\" He said to them, \"You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.\" And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. But Jesus called them to him and said, \"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave; even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\""

    "epistle": "I Corinthians 14:26-40\nBRETHREN, when you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret. But if there is no one to interpret, let each one of them keep silence in church and speak to himself and to God. Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. If a revelation is made to another by sitting by, let the first be silent. For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged; and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. But God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints, the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. What! Did the word of God originate with you, or are you the only one it has reached? If any one thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord. If any one does not recognize this, he is not recognized. So, my brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues; but all things should be done decently and in order. ",

When evening came, he was there alone, but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, \"It is a ghost!\" And they cried out for fear.

Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother. So too the second and third, down to the seventh. After them all, the woman died. In the resurrection, therefore, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her.\" But Jesus answered them, \"You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven. And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?' He is not God of the dead, but of the living.\" And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching."

No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.\" Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him. Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death, yet they asked Pilate to have him killed. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead; and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus.",
    "gospel": "Matthew 14:1-13\nAt that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus; and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.\" For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because John said to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given; he sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place apart. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.\n\nEpistle Reading: Acts 13:25-33\nIN THOSE DAYS, as John was finishing his course, he said, \"What do you suppose that I am?

And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus.\n\nGospel Reading: Mark 6:14-30\nAt that time, Herod the King heard about the fame of Jesus, for his name had become known. He said, \"John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.\" But others said, \"It is Elijah.\" And others said, \"It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" But when Herod heard of it he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her. For John said to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly. But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it.\" And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.\" And she went out, and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the baptizer.\" And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" And the king was exceedingly sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb. The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught."

    "epistle": "II Corinthians 5:15-21\nBrethren, Christ died for all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.\n\nFrom now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.",
    "gospel": "Mark 1:16-22\nAt that time, Jesus, passing along by the Sea of Galilee, saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, \"Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men.\" And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boats mending the nets. And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him. And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught. And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes."

    "epistle": "Hebrews 9:1-7\nBRETHREN, the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. For a tent was prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail. These preparations having thus been made, the priests go continually into the outer tent, performing their ritual duties; but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people.",
    "gospel": "Luke 10:38-42, 11:27-28\nAt that time, Jesus entered a village; and a woman called Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said, \"Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve you alone? Tell her then to help me.\" But the Lord answered her, \"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.\" As he said this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, \"Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that you sucked!\" But he said, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\""
